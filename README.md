# socketio-chat-app

This `express` application was a small project used to get me more familiar with [socket.io](https://socket.io). To make this, I used socket.io in `Golang`, `HTML`, and `javascript`. Lastely, this project is hosted on a free heroku dyno instance which deploys automatically on `git push -u origin main` calls.

## IMPLEMENTATION

The implementation of the application contains two components. One `server` side and one `client` side. Where both components monitor and emit events based on user input. This communication between the two components is bi-directional based websockets. Note, all chat room are apart of the default namespace (`/`).

Utimately, the `server` serves all the client which all connect to it. Firstly, the `server` monitors for `connection` clients. After a client is connected the `server` will monitor for three events to occur. Those events being `new user`, `send message`, and `disconnect`. Where `new user` handles adding a new user to a chat room and emitting a `chat sub msg` event to the `clients` in that room as well. The `received message` event emits the sent chat message to all the other `clients` connected to the current chat room. Lastely, the `disconnect` event broadcasts to the other `clients` still in the chat that the user has left. 

The `client` emits one event and monitors for 2 events. The emitting being `send message` which the server monitors for. This event is used to send msg to the `server` to be sent to other `clients` The `client` monitored events are `receive message` and `chat sub msg` which are emitted from the `server`. This populates the chat application with other users messages.

In short, either client or server will emit an event which is being monitored by the client or server. When this happened either the client or server will take actions accordingly. Whether that is to display the received msg or broadcast the msg to the other clienst.

## Use Case: Send a message to another chat.

Given there is two users connect to the a chat room.

When a user sends a message.

Then the users client side code will emit the `send message` event containing the msg and name data.

Then the server which monitors for the `send message` event will broadcast/emit the `received message` event for the current chat room.

Then all the other clients which monitor for the `received message` event in the chat room will display the msg.
